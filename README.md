# CSCI-43700: Game Engine

## Game Overview:
This simple 2D game is based on the idea of "drive a car, hit a ball." You control a car sprite that you move around the screen and hit balls with. Players experience basic game dynamics through simple movement and collision detection.

## Technology Choices:
The game utilizes Python, a versatile, high-level programming language, along with Pygame, a widely-used set of Python modules designed specifically for video game creation. This combination provides ease of development and the capability to handle sprite management, collision detection, boundary detection, and rendering.

## How to Play:
The player controls the car sprite with the arrow keys. The goal is to connect with the ball sprites. Every time the car hits a ball, a message appears on the screen. This could be used to keep track of points or other game elements.

## Installation and Gameplay Instructions:
Python and Pygame must be on the machine for the game to work. Then, the code for the game and the pictures of the car and ball need to be saved in a.py file. If you run this file in a system that can handle Python, the game will start. Use the arrow keys to move around.

## Lessons Learned:
The process of making this game taught me about the basic parts of game creation, such as game loops, sprite management, collision detection, and boundary detection. It showed how important these things are for making a game that is easy to play and responds well. It also showed how these basic ideas are used to make more complicated games.
